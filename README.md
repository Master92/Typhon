# About Typhon
## The idea
The Typhon was born out of the need for a 6" lite weight race frame that is durable and can compete with the fastest pilots in the world.  This is a design concept I came up and iterated on with Mason "Hyper" Lively as well as Randy "Gator" Jeppesen over the course of the 2021 season and this is the 7th version and it has turned out perfect. This frame allowed Mason to capture the Top Qualifying Time at the 2021 MultiGP Champs with Mason finsihing in 5th (two mid-airs). Sp3cimen finished 3rd on this frame in the Sportsman Class and several others making it the top 40 and next 40.  The frame is 25-30g ligther than other 6" race frames and if I released 5" arms it would be lighter than that best selling 5" race frames on the market and surely more durable.  This current designed if using T700 for the arms is in fact more durable than the top selling race from on the market as of 2021.

Top MultiGP Pilots currently flying this frame are Mason "Hyper" Lively, Tristan "TDog_FPV" Tefft, Rick "SSBelmont" Caudle, Randy "Gator" Jeppesen, Ryan "MegaHurts" Davis, ProDangles, SolidFPV, CoryRC, Sp3cimen and several other pilots.

Typhon
Typhon (/ˈtaɪfɒn, -fən/; Greek: Τυφῶν, [typʰɔ̂ːn]), also Typhoeus (/taɪˈfiːəs/; Τυφωεύς), Typhaon (Τυφάων) or Typhos (Τυφώς), was a monstrous serpentine giant and one of the deadliest creatures in Greek mythology. According to Hesiod, Typhon was the son of Gaia and Tartarus. However, one source has Typhon as the son of Hera alone, while another makes Typhon the offspring of Cronus. Typhon and his mate Echidna were the progenitors of many famous monsters.

## Project naming requirements
Typhon is the name of the frame.  If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have used as basis of the project, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON V7”. 

If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between TYPHON and your project.
Accessories from the TYPHON project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON FPV Camera Mount”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON FPV Camera Mount V1 - V2”.
