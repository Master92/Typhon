# About Typhon
## The idea
The Typhon was born out of the need for a 6" lite weight race frame that is durable and can compete with the fastest pilots in the world.  This is a design concept I came up and iterated on with Mason "Hyper" Lively as well as Randy "Gator" Jeppesen over the course of the 2021 season and this is the 7th version and it has turned out perfect. This frame allowed Mason to capture the Top Qualifying Time at the 2021 MultiGP Champs with Mason finishing in 5th (two mid-airs). Sp3cimen finished 3rd on this frame in the Sportsman Class and several others making it the top 40 and next 40.  The frame is 25-30g lighter than other 6" race frames and if I released 5" arms it would be lighter than that bestselling 5" race frames on the market and surely more durable.  This current designed if using T700 for the arms is in fact more durable than the top selling race from on the market as of 2021.

Top MultiGP Pilots currently flying this frame are Mason "Hyper" Lively, Tristan "TDog_FPV" Tefft, Rick "SSBelmont" Caudle, Randy "Gator" Jeppesen, Ryan "MegaHurts" Davis, ProDangles, SolidFPV, CoryRC, Sp3cimen and several other pilots.

Typhon
Typhon (/ˈtaɪfɒn, -fən/; Greek: Τυφῶν, [typʰɔ̂ːn]), also Typhoeus (/taɪˈfiːəs/; Τυφωεύς), Typhaon (Τυφάων) or Typhos (Τυφώς), was a monstrous serpentine giant and one of the deadliest creatures in Greek mythology. According to Hesiod, Typhon was the son of Gaia and Tartarus. However, one source has Typhon as the son of Hera alone, while another makes Typhon the offspring of Cronus. Typhon and his mate Echidna were the progenitors of many famous monsters.

## Additional Arms
I have designed a short skinny 5" arm in both 5mm and 6mm thickness.  I have also designed a 5.5" skinny arm that is based on the short skinny arm in both 5mm and 6mm thickness.  Again, it's important to use T700 CF and often times China will sell you T300 and tell you it's T700.  One way to tell is it's T300 is to break a known T300 arm and break T700 arm, the CF thread count is higher for the T700.  It's not perfect but if the 6mm arms are breaking and getting twisty after 10-20 packs it's likely not T700.  I have had 6mm T700 arms last me the whole season in 2021 all the way up to IO.

I have included .STEP, .F3D and .IGES files.  In some cases I provide .DXF but the .STEP, F3D and .IGES files are 3D drawings, so if you need a 2D file you can export form these.  All these files can be find in the folder.


* T_v7_5_Inch_Shorty_Brace_3mm - 5" Shorty 3mm brace (I recommend the 6mm thick arm with no brace)
* T_v7_5_Inch_Arm_Lock_2mm     - Arm Lock for the 5mm thick arms works with any 5mm arm
* T_v7_Arm_5_Inch_Shorty_5mm   - 5" Skinny Shorty Arm in 5mm thickness
* T_v7_Arm_5_Inch_Shorty_6mm   - 5" Skinny Shorty Arm in 6mm thickness
* T_v7_Arm_5.5_Inch_6mm	       - 5.5" Skinny Arm modeled after  5" Skinny Shorty 6mm thickness 

My general conclusion is our motors have so much torque today, you need a wider 5mm Arm or a thicker skinny arm and it needs to be cut from T700 CF.  So the 5" skinny arms I am not a fan of when cut from 5mm.  You will get much better performance from a 6mm skinny arm with very little additional weight.  It's possible to cut these out of 5.5mm thickness but I think it's a waste of time, just use 6mm, the weight savings isn't worth it. 

## Arm Lock Notes
* T_v7_Arm_Lock1_2x.dxf  - You will need QTY 2 of these for a 5mm build
* T_v7_Arm_Lock2_2x.dxf  - You will need QTY 2 of these for a 6mm build ( can you use either those actually, but you will need to file the nubs down if you use the 6mm version on a 5mm arm.)

## Project naming requirements
Typhon is the name of the frame.  If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have used as basis of the project, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON V7”.

If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between TYPHON and your project.
Accessories from the TYPHON project also needs to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON FPV Camera Mount”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “SOUTHEAST TYPHON FPV Camera Mount V1 - V2”.
