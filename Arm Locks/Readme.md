There are two versions of the Arm Locks, v1 is used with the 6mm Arms and v2 is usded with the 5mm arms.  Technically, the v2 could be used with a 6mm arm, but you would loose .5mm on top and bottom of the arm lock, not really a big deal.

Take a look at the images below to get an idea of the difference in sizes.

## Arm Lock for 5mm Arm

## Arm Lock for 6mm Arm
File(s): - T_v8_Arm_Lock_6_Inch_2mm.dxf or T_v8_Arm_Lock_6_Inch_2mm.step

These very rearly break.  If you don't want to order two different versions, just have the 6 inch version cut and file it down as needed if using a 5mm arm.
