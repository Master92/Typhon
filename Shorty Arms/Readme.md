# Typhon Shorty Arms 
**Update: 4/16/2023** <br>
**Adds Made By: Rick (SSBelmont)**

These arms are as short as possible but will still allow for a 5.1" props.  The goal is to have a very light arm but yet still durable.  I run both the Shorty 5mm Arms and 6mm Arms (I lean toward the 6mm arms).

Take a look at the images below to get an idea of the difference in sizes.

## Shorty Arm Brace
I don't run the brace with my 6mm Arms but I do run it on my Shorty 5mm Arm builds.  You don't have to use the brace with the 5mm arms, but you will find it allows the arms to last much longer.  As with any skinny 5mm Arm, they will delaminate over time and will get twisty resulting in the quad not flying as well (will cause hot motors as well).
