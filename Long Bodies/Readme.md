# Typhon Long Bodies

Many people have asked me to design a long body in order to allow for the longer ESCs that are being sold today.  As result I have created two long bodies, a Long and an Extra Long version.  The Long version will work fine with with the TMotor 60a, Foxeer Reaper Slim, Rush, Redux 60a, Redux 70a.  The XL will work with any of the 20x20 ESCs on the market and gives more clearance near the center pressnut in the mid-plate.

Take a look at the images below to get an idea of the difference in sizes.

Now, compare the long bodies to the regular body to get a better understanding of the differences
