# Typhon Long Bodies
**Update: 4/16/2023**
**Adds Made By: Rick (SSBelmont)**

Many people have asked me to design a long body in order to allow for the longer ESCs that are being sold today.  As result I have created two long bodies, a Long Version and an extra long version.  The Long version will work fine with with the TMotor 60a, Foxeer Reaper Slim, Rush, Redux 60a, Redux 70a.  The XL (extra-long) will work with any of the 20x20 ESCs on the market and gives more clearance near the center pressnut in the mid-plate.

Take a look at the images below to get an idea of the difference in sizes.
